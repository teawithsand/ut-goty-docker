# Building docker image & running it

## Perquisites

- Make sure that `./ut-data` contains installed game, which was generated by build game step.
- Do following on host machine:
```shell
sudo apt install osspd osspd-pulseaudio
sudo systemctl start osspd.service
```
This creates /dev/dsp and /dev/mixer, which are required for audio subsystem. You can omit that step, but then remove following lines from docker-compose.yml
```yaml
devices:
    - /dev/dsp
    - /dev/mixer
```
Otherwise an error will occur, as these can't be mounted if they do not exist.

## Running/building
Run `docker build` or preferably `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up` and the game should work.
